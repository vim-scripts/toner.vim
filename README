Toner is a plugin for interactively and visually toning vim highlight colors.

See https://github.com/niklasl/vim-toner for full details (and development).

(Toner requires Vim 7 compiled with |+float|, and user settings 'nocompatible', |:syntax| on etc., as might be expected.)

The HSL and hue rotation code is from huerotation.vim (Vim Script #2283) by
Yukihiro Nakadaira. See http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2283
(placed in the public domain). Many thanks for this!
